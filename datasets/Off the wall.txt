She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years, she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside!
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life



Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind
Helpless like a baby
Sensual disguise
I can't help but love you
It's getting better all the time

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles to your eyes
Like a trip to Heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
Wouldn't help it, no, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
Wouldn't help it, no, no, no



It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the bein' in love that makes me cry, cry
You've got me fallin' in love
Got me fallin' in love
(Cry, cry, cry, cry)

You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time, I'm trying not to go too far, 'cause

No matter how it starts, it ends the same
Someone's always doin' someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(All night)

And though I'm tryin' not to look in your eyes
Each time I do, they kind of burn right through me
Don't wanna lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet, my heart is sayin', "Come and do me"

Now, we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be
But here I go fallin' again

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry, cry, cry

Over you, over you (All night)
It's the fallin' in love (You got me fallin' in love)
Got me fallin' in love (Being in love makes me)
Cry, cry, cry

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin'
