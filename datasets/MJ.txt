She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years, she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside!
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life



Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind
Helpless like a baby
Sensual disguise
I can't help but love you
It's getting better all the time

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles to your eyes
Like a trip to Heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
Wouldn't help it, no, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
Wouldn't help it, no, no, no



It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the bein' in love that makes me cry, cry
You've got me fallin' in love
Got me fallin' in love
(Cry, cry, cry, cry)

You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time, I'm trying not to go too far, 'cause

No matter how it starts, it ends the same
Someone's always doin' someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(All night)

And though I'm tryin' not to look in your eyes
Each time I do, they kind of burn right through me
Don't wanna lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet, my heart is sayin', "Come and do me"

Now, we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be
But here I go fallin' again

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry, cry, cry

Over you, over you (All night)
It's the fallin' in love (You got me fallin' in love)
Got me fallin' in love (Being in love makes me)
Cry, cry, cry

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin'

Every night, she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine, mhm

I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well, I love you endlessly
(Loving, we will share)
So come and go with me to one town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day, you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?
Ha, ha, Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover, not a fighter
Eh, I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yeah, she said it; you keep dreaming

(I don't believe it!) (Mine, mine)
(No, no, no) The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
(No, mine) No, mine (Mine, mine)

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller, here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow)

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Ooh, babe (Thriller night)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Oh, darling (Oh, baby)
Thriller night, babe (Thriller night, babe)
Ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller



They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it (Ooh!)
You better run, you better do what you can (Ooh!)
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (Ooh!)

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Don't break no hearts; hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee-hee, ah, hee-hee-hee)

Hee, hoo

She says I am the one, uh
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no, hoo, ohh)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no (No-no-no, ah), no-no-no-no (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (No)
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)

She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breakin' my heart, babe)
She says I am the one
Yeah, yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl)
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; don't call me Billie Jean, hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; she's not at the scene)
Billie Jean is not (Hee), aaow, ooh
Yeah, Billie Jean is



Why?

Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?

Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Just tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a-round)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why? Oh, why?
(That way) Why? Oh, why?

Looking out across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a-round)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?), why (Why?)
Cha-da-cha-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha (Aah-ah)
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (Why? Why?), why (Why? Why? Why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a-round)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em! (Aah-ah)
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?), why (Why?)
Ooh, tell 'em!
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a-round)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
I like living this way

Why? Oh, why? (That way)
Why? Oh, why? (That way)
Why? Oh, why? (That way)

I'm headed for the border, it's on my mind
And nothing really matters, I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror, is he hot on my tracks?
Is he getting nearer? I feel some heat is on my back

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Doing it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon)
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

Cho

Ain't nothing gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway
I gotta really burn this road

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Doing it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing

Just pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

Cho

Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said, "The future's in your hands
The life you save could be your own"
You're preaching 'bout my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like for me there's no tomorrow
Go, go, go, aaow!

Cho, oh

Liberian girl, you came and you changed my world
A love so brand new
Liberian girl, you came and you changed me, girl
A feeling so true

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says, "Do you love me?"
And he says, "So endlessly
I love you, Liberian girl"

Nakupenda pia
Nakutaka pia (Ooh-ooh, baby)

Nakupenda pia
Nakutaka pia (Ooh-ooh, baby)

Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
I wait for the day
When you have to say, "I do"

I love you, Liberian girl all the time

I watched you on the floor, cheek-to-cheek
She's getting to you
You didn't see her eyes on me, no
She looked right through you
(Before you make) Before you make
(A big mistake) Remember
That looks can fool you, babe, hee
There's something I would sure appreciate
(If you can keep a secret)

Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
Baby loves me, no, she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me, ooh)

And if they ask her
Tell 'em that we're just good friends
Dah-chika, chika-chika
Just good friends
Ah-chika, chika-ah-ooh
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, hee, aaow)

You better take advice, never trust first impressions
I tried to hide this affair from their suspicions
So even if she's asking you to stay
You better know where you stand

Baby loves me, though she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
But my baby loves me, though she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me, ooh)

Now, if they ask you
Just tell 'em that we're just good friends
Yes, just good friends
Dah-chika, chika-chika
Root-doo-doo-doo (Doot-do-do-do)
Just good friends

I guess the lady is still making up her mind
Say we're just good friends (Oh)

Baby loves me, though she never shows she cares
No, you won't see her kiss and hug me (Just good friends)
My baby loves me, though she acts like I'm not there (Aaow)
You doggone lover, hee, no-no-no-no

Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares (She loves me)

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh, yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ohh yeah!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man, you know, that man)
(Well I'll change!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Gonna feel real good (Oh, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na)
Yeah, yeah, oh no, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, hoo!
(Man in the mirror) You've got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You've got to, you got to move, shamone, shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah), stand up (Make that change), stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Aaow! (Yeah, make that change)
Go make that change, shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)
Make that change



Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (Ah), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do" (I do)
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you (Woah-oh)
I just can't stop loving you (If I stop)
And if I stop (Uh-huh)
Then tell me just what will I do (Woah-oh)
I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you (No, baby, oh)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop (Oh, oh)
Then tell me just what will I do (Oh, oh, what will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Hee-hee-hee, love you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (I know I do)
And if I stop (Oh, oh, oh)
Then tell me just what will I do



You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

She's saying "That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back"
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
(Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no)

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's saying "That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star"

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Diana
Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana, -iana, -iana
C'mon!
No, no, oh-, stop this

She said "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"

Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright"
I said "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key"
She said "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me"

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana) (Hey, hey)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no) (Hey, baby, won't you-)

C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)



Ow!
Cha!
Shoo-ca-choo-ca!

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A smooth criminal
Ow!

So they came in to the out way
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom

Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

Jam
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff

It ain't too much for me to
Jam

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal hat, the man is Mike, so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first, I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
'Cause it ain't too hard to

Jam

Got to give it (Uh-huh)
You just want to give it



They say I'm different, they don't understand
But there's a bigger problem that's much more in demand
You've got world hunger, not enough to eat
So there's really no time to be trippin' on me
You've got school teachers who don't wanna teach
You've got grown people who can't write or read
You got strange diseases, ah, but there's no cure
You got many doctors that aren't so sure
So tell me

(Why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
Stop trippin'

We've got more problems than we'll ever need
You got gang violence and bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people with no food to eat
With no clothes on their back and no shoes for their feet
We've got drug addiction in the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption, police brutality
We've got streetwalkers walking into darkness
Tell me, what are we doing
To try to stop this?

(Why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?

There's something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me, don't hide our love
Woman to man

She's just a lover who's doin' me by

Then if you want it, then won't you taste it?
She wants to give it

She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it (She wanna get it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Ah, she wants to give it

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust, woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets, make your move, set me free

Oh, because there's somethin' about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's somethin' about you, baby (Oh)

Just promise me whatever we say or whatever we do to each other
For now, we'll make a vow to just keep it in the closet

If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's achin', you have to rub it
She wants to give it

And you know damn well she gives it to me
Uh-huh!
Black jeans and a turtleneck sweater

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember (I'll make you remember)
Back in the fall? (I'll make you remember)
We'd be together (I'll make you remember)
All day long (I know you remember)
Do you remember (I'll make you remember)

In each other's eyes (I'll make you remember)
We'd stare (I know), tell me

Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so," "I'll never let you go"

Do you remember (I'll make you remember)
Back in the spring? (I know you remember)
Every morning (I'll make you remember)
The birds would sing (I know you remember)
Do you remember (I'll make you remember)
Those special times? (I know you remember)
They'll just go on and on (I'll make you remember)
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)

I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now, I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie? (Is it just a lie)
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true (Make a dream come true)

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But everytime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still, you said goodbye (Still, you said goodbye)

If I let her get away
Then the world will have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who set you free

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

I got the feeling trouble's gotta stop
I got the feeling she's never gonna drop
I got the feeling she's never gonna stop
I got the feeling but she's never gonna know
My friends thought she's gonna like it
I got the feeling but she's never gonna take it
I got the feeling her head's all fucked up
I got the feeling she's out to play

(Can't let go, oh)
I got to let go, I got a feeling but she's never gonna let me
(Can't let go, oh)
Gotta see her, how are they gonna stop me?
I got a feeling, but she's never gonna be
Got a feeling, but she's gonna find a way
I never feel it, but she's never gonna find a way

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away



Think about, um, the generations and, uh, say we wanna make it a better place for our children and our children's children, so that they, they, they s—they know it's a better world for them, and think if they can make it a better place...

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
So make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place (Better place)
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place (Better place)
For you and for me and the entire human race (Oh, no)
There are people dying (Oh)
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

(Yeah) There are people dying (Oh)
If you care enough for the living
(Then) Make a better place for you and for me
(Everyone, there are) There are people dying (Oh)
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

(Hey!) What?
(Turn it off) But dad, this is the best part!
(Turn it off) No!
(It's too late for this, turn it off)
Dad, this is the best part, come on
(No, turn it off now) No, this is the—, I wanna listen to it, okay?
Right, too late? Sure, eat this

Aaow! (Ooh)
Aaow!

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh

They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em, "I ain't second to none"

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, hoo

Gone wit' ya, babe
Hee-hee

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Go when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Go when the going gets mean

Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from, it's where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye (Hee-hee)
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Alright, alright (Ooh-ooh)
Alright (Yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah, now
Alright, alright (Ooh-ooh)
Shamone, don't (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, now, alright, ah
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to beat, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white (It's white)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to beat, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo!



I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

And she promised me forever and a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret that she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter and it doesn't seem right
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune
Still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure 'cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me, did she find in someone else?

Who is it?
Is it a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever that we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me for such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see, what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter and it doesn't seem right
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune
Still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure 'cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter, she just up and ran away

Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

(Hee-hee, hee-hee)
Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, we never were
Just won't stop
Don't bother me, don't bother me

Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
Who is it?
To me, I'm bothered
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee)
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune
Still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Body)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (Da da da da)
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune
Still, I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (You can really say I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune
Still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be, don't be, don't be judging)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me (Don't be, don't do)
Did she find in someone else? (Can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (This won't cut it)
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune
Still, I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be judging)
'Cause I'm bothered every day (Don't be, don't be)
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (Can't you really feel I'm lonely?)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune
Still, I cry alone at night (She don't, she don't want me)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day (She don't, she don't, she don't need it)
And she didn't leave a letter (She don't, she don't want it)
She just upped and ran away (Is it my brother?)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me, you just couldn't)
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune (Da da, da da, da da, da)
Still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Hee!)
'Cause I'm lying to myself (Hee!)
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else? (I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)



She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone

Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me

Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me

You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay, yes, it's okay
You won't be laughing, girl, when I'm not around
I'll be okay
And I'd, I'd never find
Better, a peace of mind, no

Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Talk to me, woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me
Oh, love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me, give in to me

I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to the fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
I'd like a lady
Talk to me, baby
Give in to me
Give in to the fire
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Love is wrong
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
Give in to the feeling



Hold me like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee, "You are my friend"
Carry me like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

Weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?
But they told me a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end, but I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show it to me?
You'll be there for me and care enough to bear me

Hold me (Show me)
Lay your head lowly (Told me)
Softly then boldly (Yeah!)
Carry me there (I'm only human)
Lead me (Hold me)
Love me and feed me (Yeah, yeah!)
Kiss me and free me (Yeah!)
I will feel blessed (I'm only human)
Carry (Carry!)
Carry me boldly (Carry me!)
Lift me up slowly (Yeah!)

Save me (Lift me)
Heal me and bathe me (Lift me up, lift me up)
Softly you say to me, "I will be there"
I will be there
Lift me, lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly (Yeah!)
Show me you care
Hold me (Hoo!)
Lay your head lowly (It gets lonely sometimes)
I get lonely, yeah, yeah
Softly then boldly
Carry me there
Need me (Hoo!)
Love me and feed me (Lift me up, hold me up)
Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed

In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care? Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart



If you called out loud, would it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender, to your alibis?
And you can say the words like you understand
But the power's in believin', so give yourself a chance

'Cause you can climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it and a little self-esteem

So keep the faith, don't let nobody turn you 'round
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off of the ground, ah

Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself, no matter what it's gonna take
You can be a winner, but you got to keep the faith

Ah, gon' keep it, brother
You got it

(Ooh-ooh) And when you think of trust, does it lead you home (Oh, ah-ah)
To a place that you only dream of when you're all alone?
(Ooh-ooh) And you can go by the feel 'stead of circumstance
But the power's in believin', so give yourself a chance

I know that you can sail across the water
Float across the sky, ah
Any road that you take will get you there
If you'll only try

So keep the faith, ow

Makes it (Ah-ah-ah), uh, makes it right

Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon

Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon

Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

Born to amuse
To inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

Gone too soon



The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee-hee!)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl, I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said "You know my name"
(She called me!)
"And don't you pretend you never did me before"
(Don't you, don't you, do it!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't you) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!

I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby!

And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Dog gone!) (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Woah!) (Oh, yeah!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee! Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hoo-hee! Hoo!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
My baby
You been, you take, uh
You don't, don't, don't
You turn, my baby
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Dangerous
Dangerous, dangerous
Hoo!
Dangerous, dangerous
Hoo!

All I wanna say is that

But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be
No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation (Hoo-hoo)

I was wanderin' in the rain
(Mask of life, feelin' insane)
Swift and sudden fall from grace
(Sunny days seem far away)
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
(Stalin's tomb won't let me be)
On and on and on, it came
(Wish the rain would just let me)

How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone and you're cold inside?

Here, abandoned in my fame
(Armageddon of the brain)
KGB was doggin' me (Hee)
(Take my name and just let me be)
Then a beggar boy called my name (Hee)
(Happy days will drown the pain)
On and on and on, it came and the rain and again and again
(Take my name and just let me)

How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone and you're cold inside?

(Привет, Michael)

How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone and you're cold inside?

Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord, have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow (Hee)
Lord, have mercy
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm livin' lonely
I'm livin' lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

Money
Money
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church and read the holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now, you're wearing a badge, you're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you, my friend, but

If you show me the cash, then I will take it
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

Insurance? Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers

If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

You say you wouldn't do it for all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man, then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie, then I will tell him
If it's dealing with God, then you will hell Him
You would do anything for money

Anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin

Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone, oh-oh-oh

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin', fly
And girl, you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you (Ooh)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone (You are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away, you and me)
I am here to stay
But you are not alone (You are always in my heart)
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh-oh)

('Lone, 'lone) You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
('Lone, 'lone) You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
('Lone, 'lone) If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
('Lone, 'lone) Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh
('Lone, 'lone) Together, together
('Lone, 'lone) Not, not being alone
Not, not being alone
You believe in me



Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding 'round
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart, then ask
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood (Childhood)
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my childhood?



Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next, for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory

It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen, you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it (Read it)
And you don't have to eat it (Eat it)
To buy it is to feed it (Feed it)
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves?

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual

In the hood, frame him if you could
Shoot to kill, to blame him if you will
If he dies, sympathize
Such false witnesses, damn self-righteousness
In the black, stab me in the back
In the face, to lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of all your glory

It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it (Buy it)
And they won't glorify it ('Fy it)
To read it sanctifies it ('Fies it)
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves?

(Baby! Baby!)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine (Release me)
Or see it on the TV screen (Somebody release me)
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual

Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anythin' for news
And you don't go and buy it (Buy it)
And they won't glorify it ('Fy it)
To read it sanctifies it ('Fies it)
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves?
Slander!
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen, you torture men
But why do we keep foolin' ourselves?

(Baby! Baby!)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine

You're so damn disrespectable

Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ's on my team, theme
Reality brings forth realism
It's the man of steel, organism, T.W.I.S.M
I'm full of trisim, take charge like manila
9-5 Shaq represent with the thriller
Grab my crotch, twist my knees, and I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad, who are you?

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Too bad, too bad about it

Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh, the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh, the blood in her hair

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain

But only the man from next door
Knew little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh, the blood in her hair

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there
She knew no one cared

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh, it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair



Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

If you smile with your fear and sorrow
Smile, and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear
May be ever so near

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile, and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know it's fled its tomb
Because now it's haunting me, I don't understand it!

Hey!
I don't understand it!
Aaow!

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, I don't understand it!

Got a ghost, got a break in the walls (Hey!)
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?
(Don't understand it!)
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?

You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, don't understand it!

Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?



There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of a heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghostly haunting everywhere

I'm gonna be exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me because you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see eccentric oddities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?
Ooh, babe

There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin, it lay open
Where a restless soul is smoking

I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
So tell me, is it scary for you, baby? Tell me, hoo!
So tell me, is it crazy for you, baby?
Am I scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you?

Masquerade the heart is to hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you seek of me
'Cause the heart reveals the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See, the evil one is you

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
So tell me, am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Is it scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Am I scary for you, boy? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)

(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)

Is this scary for you, baby?
Is this scary for you?
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you, baby? Oh
Oh, baby


Invincible

Now I'm just wondering why you think
That you can get to me with anything?
Seems like you'd know, by now, when and how I get down
And with all that I've been through, I'm still around

Don't you ever make no mistake, baby, I got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get me (Come on, now)
And why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be
See, I'm too much for you, baby (Take on)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cuse I'm unbreakable

Doo, doo, dah
Oh, ah, well

Now, you can't stop me, even though you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughing, ha, while surfacing

Don't you ever make no mistake, baby, I've got what it takes (Yeah)
And there's no way you'll ever get me (You can't do it, baby)
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me? (Come on)
'Cause I won't let it be, see, I'm too much for you, baby
(I'm too much for you, baby)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me (You can't break me), 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it (I'm unbreakable), you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me (You can't touch me), 'cause I'm untouchable (Why do you do it, baby?)
And I know you hate it (Come on, now), and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me—
You can't stand it because I'm unbreakable

You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here (Be here)
Through all your lies and silly games, I'ma still remain the same
I'm (Uh, uh) unbreakable (What? Uh)

Crack baggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert E's, street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messing with the devil, what?

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (Yeah)
And you can't touch me, ah (I'm untouchable), 'cause I'm untouchable ('Cause I'm untouchable)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me (Yeah), 'cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (You, you, you, you, you)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it (You hate it), and you can't take it (Ooh)
You'll never break me (I'm unbreakable), 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it, (Hoo, hoo, hoo), you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me (Yeah, ah), 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it (Why did you do it?), and you can't take it (Just why did you do it?)
You'll never break me—
You can't touch me, you can't break me
You can't stand it because I'm unbreakable

Aaow!
Gone



Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes, I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no

That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

She plays a game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now, she's thinking that I will never know
And she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same

That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

I never thought that I would stop dreaming about you
Stop being without you
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you
Start being without you
But I’ll find a way to go and start doing without you
Stop talking about you
And what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away

You playing, huh?
I thought it was love with this game, huh?
When you dealing with the emotions of pain, huh?
Take a closer look when you're dealing with a stranger
I can't change her, now
Heart murder in place then you'll see
It won't heal from Pepsi, they see
Ball-hard player, she's a star player
I need this crap, huh?
I didn't see the heartbreaker, come on

That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker



Well, well, uh
Well, well, uh

If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But, girl, you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you, but still, you say it ain't cool

If there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, and he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

So why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible
Girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible

Well, well, see
Well, well
Come on now, oh

Now, many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me, how does it seem that you ain't checking for me?
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

And if there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
Girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible

Now some way, I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in this time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed (Fats, MJ, Darkchild)
To do for you, my baby (Listen, come on)

Yo, mami, stop the frontin', I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, y'all have jetlag and still be fine (Come on now)
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough (Uh-huh)
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough (Uh-huh)
Now, the way you resisting, this ain't cool (Real)
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible (Yeah, yeah)

Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Oh)
Can you feel me?
She's invincible (Oh, yeah)
She's invincible
She's invincible (Yeah, now you tell me, baby)
Are you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Yeah)
You see the girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Yeah, yeah, hey)
She's invincible (Hey)
Hee-hee
She's invincible (Hey)
She's invincible (Ooh)
She's in-, she's invincible

Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible (Yeah, yeah)

Tell the angels, "No"
I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
I would tell them, "Bring me back to her"
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

You're beautiful, you're wonderful
Incredible, I love you so
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you, girl, it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me, I'd tell them, "No"

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
I would tell them, "Bring me back to her"
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Unthinkable
Me sittin' up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be movin' on
(Movin' on)
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touchin' her
Couldn't take nobody lovin' you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me, I'd tell them, "No!"

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
(My baby!)
I don't want nobody else to hold you
(Don't you do this to me!)
That's a chance I'll take
(If the angels come around!)
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
(Just tell them to bring me down to my baby!)
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
(Don't you do this do me!)
I would tell them, "Bring me back to her"
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Oh, no, can't be without my baby
(I can't be without my baby!)
Won't go without her, I'd go crazy
(You can't do this to me!)
Oh, no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(See, if the angels come around, just tell them to bring me down, to my baby!)
Ooh
Oh, no, can't be without my baby
(Don't you do this to me!)
Won't go, without her, I'd go crazy
(I can't be without my baby!)
Oh, no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(I love you, girl! I need you, baby! I want you, baby!)
No!

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
I would tell them, "Bring me back to her"
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Leave us alone
Just leave us alone
(You're beautiful, you’re wonderful, incredible, I love you so)
Leave us alone
Please leave us alone
(You’re beautiful)
Please leave us alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
I said leave me alone



Got-t-t-t me, that girl
Oh, man! Look at that girl right there!
Goodness gracious! Uh! That girl's fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine, too!
She is banging!
Ooh, She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Ah-uh-uh-uh-uh, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
Pfft, You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't
I can get her
All right! Shamone, then, shamone!
Watch

I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that

Oh-oh-oh

My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk, the way I talk

But girl, you know it's true
So stay with me, fulfill my dreams

I've waited patiently
And girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do

All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my call
When I'm tryna get through
Keep me wonderin' why when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
'Cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I

All I got to say is that I must be dreamin', it can't be real
You're not here with me
See, but I can feel you near to me, yeah

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel, but I am

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am far away and nothing is for real

When I'm with you, I am lost for words
I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel
So silently, I pray

Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you, I'm in the light where I can not be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called 'Hallowed Ground'

Speechless (Speechless), speechless (Speechless)
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you (Ooh)
I am far away and nothing is for real

I'd go anywhere and do anything
Just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I can not climb
I'm humbled in your grace

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel (You're always in my heart)
Though I'm with you
I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence, I am lost for words
Words like... like, "I love you"

Once, all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely

You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before, but now, it's all clear
You took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are my life (You are my life)

Now, I wake up every day
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me

You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You gave me strength
When I wasn't strong
You gave me hope when all hope was lost
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting for me

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are my life



Ain't the pictures enough, why do you go through so much
To get the stories you need, so you can bury me?
You've got the people confused, you tell the stories you choose
You try to get me to lose the man I really am
You keep on stalkin' me, invading my privacy
Won't you just let me be?
'Cause your cameras can't control, the minds of those who know
That you'll even sell your soul just to get your story sold

I need my privacy, yeah, yeah
I need my privacy, yeah, yeah
So paparazzi, yeah, yeah, get away from me
Just get away from me (Yeah, yeah)

Some of you still wonder why one of my friends had to die
To get a message across, that yet you haven't heard
My friend was chased and confused like many others I knew
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away
She get no second chance, she's ridiculed and harassed
Please tell me why? (Hold on) (Mercy)
Now, there's a lesson to learn, respect's not given, it's earned
Stop maliciously attackin' my integrity

I need my privacy, yeah, yeah (Hold on)
I need my privacy, yeah, yeah (Hold on)
So paparazzi, yeah, yeah, (Mercy) just get away from me
Just get away from me (Yeah, yeah) (Slash!)

Now, there's a lesson to learn, stories are twisted and turned
Stop maliciously attackin' my integrity (Oh, oh, hoo-hoo!)

I need my privacy, yeah, yeah (Hold on, hold on now)
I need my privacy, yeah, yeah (Hold on, hold on)
So paparazzi, yeah, yeah (Oh, my, don't, don't, don't you do it) get away from me, yeah, yeah (Hold on, oh my)

So paparazzi, yeah, yeah

Can you just let it?
Hah, please don't do it (Yeah, yeah)
Why do you do it?
Can you just let it? (Yeah, yeah)
Hah, do it



Ooh, don't walk away
Walk away

Don't walk away
See, I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray?

How can I stop losing you?
How can I begin to say
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long, now, all I do is cry
Can’t we find some love to take this away?
'Cause the pain gets stronger every day

How can I begin again?
How am I to understand
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah

See, and why
All my dreams been broken
I don't know where we’re going
With everything we said and all we done now
Don't let go, I don't wanna walk away
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
And why?
All my dreams been broken
I don’t know where we’re going
When everything begins to set us free
Can't you see? I don't wanna walk away

If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Please don't go)
Can't you see that you will always be? (You will always be)
Even though I had to let you go (Don't you leave me, don't you leave me)
There’s nothing left to do
Don't walk away
If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Please, please don't leave, you will always)
Can't you see that you will always be? (Can't you see you and me?)
Even though (You will always be), I had to let you go
Better leave now, don't you leave me
When there's nothin' left to do
Don't walk away
If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Oh, no, oh, yeah, baby girl)
Can't you see? (You and me), that you will always be (I won't forget you, girl, I won't forget you, girl)
Even though (I won't forget you, girl), I had to let go
Better leave now, better leave now
There's nothin' left do
Don't walk away



Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all gonna end again

Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold?
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is takin' a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me, where were you
When your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness, oh
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars (Ooh, why?)
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers, yeah, yeah, yeah

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky, oh, no (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (Come on, I need some kind of sign)
If we all cry (Cry with me) at the same time tonight
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself, alright)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one, whoa (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
You can change the world (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight

Change the world



We pray for our fathers
Pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing

So this one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

When you sit there addressing
Counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping
And my heart is weeping
Because I'm keeping a place

For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

Home with their fathers
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee

Let's pray for all the lost children
Let’s pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well and wishing them home

Eighty-five, ninety, ninety-five, one hundred
Here I come, ready or not
Last one into the forest is a rotten apple
It's so quiet in the forest
Look at all the trees
And all the lovely flowers
It's getting dark
We better go home now



He gives a nervous smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been going on
She says, "Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"

"Everything will be alright", he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy"
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
See whatever happens, don't go of my hand
See whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, just don't let go of my hand

Thank you, man
Thank you, Carlos



Tonight's story is somewhat unique
And calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh, yes, I did forget something, didn't I?
I forgot to introduce you to the monster

You're fearing me 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watchin' you when you sleep
When you're in bed, I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall
And when you scream, it's 'cause of me

I'm the living dead
The dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should feel threatened by me

You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
In one blink, I'll disappear
And then, I'll come back to haunt you

I'm tellin' you
When you lie under tomb
I'm the one watchin' you
That's why you got to be threatened by me (No, no)

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened by me

The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened (No, no, baby)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened

(You should be)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(While you sleep)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(Every time)
(You should feel)
(Threatened)
(Half of me-e-e-e)
(Threatened by me)
(So you should feel thre-e-e-eatened by me)

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened (No, no, know it)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened (She speaks to me)
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should feel threatened (And you, threatened by me, hoo-hoo!)
You should be watchin' me (Come on, baby)
You should feel threatened (Yeah)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Hoo-hoo!)
Every time your lady speaks (I ain't threatened)
She speaks to me, threatened (Hoo-hoo, I ain't threatened)
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened by me

What you have just witnessed
Could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't
It's the beginning
