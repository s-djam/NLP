Money
Money
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church and read the holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now, you're wearing a badge, you're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you, my friend, but

If you show me the cash, then I will take it
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)

Insurance? Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers

If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

You say you wouldn't do it for all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man, then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie, then I will tell him
If it's dealing with God, then you will hell Him
You would do anything for money

Anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin

Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone, oh-oh-oh

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin', fly
And girl, you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you (Ooh)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone (You are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away, you and me)
I am here to stay
But you are not alone (You are always in my heart)
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh-oh)

('Lone, 'lone) You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
('Lone, 'lone) You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
('Lone, 'lone) If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
('Lone, 'lone) Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh
('Lone, 'lone) Together, together
('Lone, 'lone) Not, not being alone
Not, not being alone
You believe in me



Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding 'round
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart, then ask
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood (Childhood)
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my childhood?



Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next, for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory

It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen, you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it (Read it)
And you don't have to eat it (Eat it)
To buy it is to feed it (Feed it)
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves?

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual

In the hood, frame him if you could
Shoot to kill, to blame him if you will
If he dies, sympathize
Such false witnesses, damn self-righteousness
In the black, stab me in the back
In the face, to lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of all your glory

It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it (Buy it)
And they won't glorify it ('Fy it)
To read it sanctifies it ('Fies it)
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves?

(Baby! Baby!)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine (Release me)
Or see it on the TV screen (Somebody release me)
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual

Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anythin' for news
And you don't go and buy it (Buy it)
And they won't glorify it ('Fy it)
To read it sanctifies it ('Fies it)
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves?
Slander!
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen, you torture men
But why do we keep foolin' ourselves?

(Baby! Baby!)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine

Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual

Just because you read it in a magazine

Don't make it factual, actual
You're so damn disrespectable



I wake up my girl, get me mad right
The king of rock come on and there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
Standin' out here
Talking, broking, never joking, smoking
Up on the corner
Do what they wanna
Get outta here
Hasta la vista

Told me that you're doing wrong
Word out shocking all along
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwing rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done nothin' for me
You are disgusting me
(Yeah, yeah)
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad

Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing, if you please
Try to bring me to my knees

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?

Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from another hole
Tell her what somebody told
What do you want from me
What do you want from me
Tired of you hunting me
(Yeah, yeah)
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad

Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standing though you're kicking me

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ's on my team, theme
Reality brings forth realism
It's the man of steel, organism, T.W.I.S.M
I'm full of trisim, take charge like manila
9-5 Shaq represent with the thriller
Grab my crotch, twist my knees, and I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad, who are you?

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Too bad, too bad about it

Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh, the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh, the blood in her hair

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain

But only the man from next door
Knew little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh, the blood in her hair

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there
She knew no one cared

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh, it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair



Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

If you smile with your fear and sorrow
Smile, and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear
May be ever so near

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile, and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
