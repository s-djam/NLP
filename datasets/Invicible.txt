Now I'm just wondering why you think
That you can get to me with anything?
Seems like you'd know, by now, when and how I get down
And with all that I've been through, I'm still around

Don't you ever make no mistake, baby, I got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get me (Come on, now)
And why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be
See, I'm too much for you, baby (Take on)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cuse I'm unbreakable

Doo, doo, dah
Oh, ah, well

Now, you can't stop me, even though you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughing, ha, while surfacing

Don't you ever make no mistake, baby, I've got what it takes (Yeah)
And there's no way you'll ever get me (You can't do it, baby)
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me? (Come on)
'Cause I won't let it be, see, I'm too much for you, baby
(I'm too much for you, baby)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me (You can't break me), 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it (I'm unbreakable), you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me (You can't touch me), 'cause I'm untouchable (Why do you do it, baby?)
And I know you hate it (Come on, now), and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me—
You can't stand it because I'm unbreakable

You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here (Be here)
Through all your lies and silly games, I'ma still remain the same
I'm (Uh, uh) unbreakable (What? Uh)

A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly .9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you in
Crack baggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert E's, street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messing with the devil, what?

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (Yeah)
And you can't touch me, ah (I'm untouchable), 'cause I'm untouchable ('Cause I'm untouchable)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me (Yeah), 'cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (You, you, you, you, you)

And I know you hate it (You hate it), and you can't take it (Ooh)
You'll never break me (I'm unbreakable), 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it, (Hoo, hoo, hoo), you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me (Yeah, ah), 'cause I'm untouchable

You'll never break me—
You can't touch me, you can't break me
You can't stand it because I'm unbreakable

Aaow!
Gone



Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes, I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no

That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

She plays a game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now, she's thinking that I will never know
And she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same

That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

I never thought that I would stop dreaming about you
Stop being without you
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you
Start being without you
But I’ll find a way to go and start doing without you
Stop talking about you
And what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away

You playing, huh?
I thought it was love with this game, huh?
When you dealing with the emotions of pain, huh?
Take a closer look when you're dealing with a stranger
I can't change her, now
Heart murder in place then you'll see
It won't heal from Pepsi, they see
Ball-hard player, she's a star player
I need this crap, huh?
I didn't see the heartbreaker, come on

That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker



Well, well, uh
Well, well, uh

If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But, girl, you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you, but still, you say it ain't cool

If there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, and he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

So why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible
Girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible

Well, well, see
Well, well
Come on now, oh

Now, many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me, how does it seem that you ain't checking for me?
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

And if there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
Girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible

Now some way, I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in this time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed (Fats, MJ, Darkchild)
To do for you, my baby (Listen, come on)

Yo, mami, stop the frontin', I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, y'all have jetlag and still be fine (Come on now)
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough (Uh-huh)
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough (Uh-huh)
Now, the way you resisting, this ain't cool (Real)
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible (Yeah, yeah)

Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Oh)
Can you feel me?
She's invincible (Oh, yeah)
She's invincible
She's invincible (Yeah, now you tell me, baby)
Are you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Yeah)
You see the girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Yeah, yeah, hey)
She's invincible (Hey)
Hee-hee
She's invincible (Hey)
She's invincible (Ooh)
She's in-, she's invincible

Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible (Yeah, yeah)

Tell the angels, "No"
I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
I would tell them, "Bring me back to her"
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

You're beautiful, you're wonderful
Incredible, I love you so
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you, girl, it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me, I'd tell them, "No"

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
I would tell them, "Bring me back to her"
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Unthinkable
Me sittin' up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be movin' on
(Movin' on)
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touchin' her
Couldn't take nobody lovin' you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me, I'd tell them, "No!"

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
(My baby!)
I don't want nobody else to hold you
(Don't you do this to me!)
That's a chance I'll take
(If the angels come around!)
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
(Just tell them to bring me down to my baby!)
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
(Don't you do this do me!)
I would tell them, "Bring me back to her"
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Oh, no, can't be without my baby
(I can't be without my baby!)
Won't go without her, I'd go crazy
(You can't do this to me!)
Oh, no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(See, if the angels come around, just tell them to bring me down, to my baby!)
Ooh
Oh, no, can't be without my baby
(Don't you do this to me!)
Won't go, without her, I'd go crazy
(I can't be without my baby!)
Oh, no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(I love you, girl! I need you, baby! I want you, baby!)
No!

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
I would tell them, "Bring me back to her"
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Leave us alone
Just leave us alone
(You're beautiful, you’re wonderful, incredible, I love you so)
Leave us alone
Please leave us alone
(You’re beautiful)
Please leave us alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
I said leave me alone



Got-t-t-t me, that girl
Oh, man! Look at that girl right there!
Goodness gracious! Uh! That girl's fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine, too!
She is banging!
Ooh, She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Ah-uh-uh-uh-uh, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
Pfft, You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't
I can get her
All right! Shamone, then, shamone!
Watch

I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that

All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my call
When I'm tryna get through
Keep me wonderin' why when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
'Cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I

All I got to say is that I must be dreamin', it can't be real
You're not here with me
See, but I can feel you near to me, yeah

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel, but I am

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am far away and nothing is for real

When I'm with you, I am lost for words
I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel
So silently, I pray

Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you, I'm in the light where I can not be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called 'Hallowed Ground'

Speechless (Speechless), speechless (Speechless)
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you (Ooh)
I am far away and nothing is for real

I'd go anywhere and do anything
Just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I can not climb
I'm humbled in your grace

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel (You're always in my heart)
Though I'm with you
I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence, I am lost for words
Words like... like, "I love you"

Once, all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely

You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before, but now, it's all clear
You took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are my life (You are my life)

Now, I wake up every day
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me

You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You gave me strength
When I wasn't strong
You gave me hope when all hope was lost
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting for me

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are my life



Ain't the pictures enough, why do you go through so much
To get the stories you need, so you can bury me?
You've got the people confused, you tell the stories you choose
You try to get me to lose the man I really am
You keep on stalkin' me, invading my privacy
Won't you just let me be?
'Cause your cameras can't control, the minds of those who know
That you'll even sell your soul just to get your story sold

I need my privacy, yeah, yeah
I need my privacy, yeah, yeah
So paparazzi, yeah, yeah, get away from me
Just get away from me (Yeah, yeah)

Some of you still wonder why one of my friends had to die
To get a message across, that yet you haven't heard
My friend was chased and confused like many others I knew
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away
She get no second chance, she's ridiculed and harassed
Please tell me why? (Hold on) (Mercy)
Now, there's a lesson to learn, respect's not given, it's earned
Stop maliciously attackin' my integrity

I need my privacy, yeah, yeah (Hold on)
I need my privacy, yeah, yeah (Hold on)
So paparazzi, yeah, yeah, (Mercy) just get away from me
Just get away from me (Yeah, yeah) (Slash!)

Now, there's a lesson to learn, stories are twisted and turned
Stop maliciously attackin' my integrity (Oh, oh, hoo-hoo!)

I need my privacy, yeah, yeah (Hold on, hold on now)
I need my privacy, yeah, yeah (Hold on, hold on)
So paparazzi, yeah, yeah (Oh, my, don't, don't, don't you do it) get away from me, yeah, yeah (Hold on, oh my)
I need my privacy, yeah, yeah
(Please don't do it, please, please don't do it)
I need my privacy, yeah, yeah (Get away from me, get away)
So paparazzi, yeah, yeah
(I'm tired of you stalkin', walkin', talkin', stalkin')
Get away from me, yeah, yeah
(You're just sartin' with me, brighter than me, stalkin' me, hold on, aah!)
Privacy, I need my privacy, yeah, yeah (You just, you just stop it, oh my)
Privacy, paparazzi, yeah, yeah (Privacy no, hee-hee-hee!)
Privacy, I need my privacy, yeah, yeah (My privacy, my privacy, privacy)
Privacy, get away from me, yeah, yeah (Privacy, no)

Privacy, yeah, why'd you do it? (Yeah, yeah)
Please don't do it
Why'd you do it? (Yeah, yeah)
Can you just let it?
Hah, please don't do it (Yeah, yeah)
Why do you do it?
Can you just let it? (Yeah, yeah)
Hah, do it



Ooh, don't walk away
Walk away

Don't walk away
See, I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray?

How can I stop losing you?
How can I begin to say
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long, now, all I do is cry
Can’t we find some love to take this away?
'Cause the pain gets stronger every day

How can I begin again?
How am I to understand
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah

See, and why
All my dreams been broken
I don't know where we’re going
With everything we said and all we done now
Don't let go, I don't wanna walk away
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
And why?
All my dreams been broken
I don’t know where we’re going
When everything begins to set us free
Can't you see? I don't wanna walk away

If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Please don't go)
Can't you see that you will always be? (You will always be)
Even though I had to let you go (Don't you leave me, don't you leave me)
There’s nothing left to do
Don't walk away
If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Please, please don't leave, you will always)
Can't you see that you will always be? (Can't you see you and me?)
Even though (You will always be), I had to let you go
Better leave now, don't you leave me
When there's nothin' left to do
Don't walk away
If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Oh, no, oh, yeah, baby girl)
Can't you see? (You and me), that you will always be (I won't forget you, girl, I won't forget you, girl)
Even though (I won't forget you, girl), I had to let go
Better leave now, better leave now
There's nothin' left do
Don't walk away



Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all gonna end again

Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold?
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is takin' a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me, where were you
When your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness, oh
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars (Ooh, why?)
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers, yeah, yeah, yeah

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky, oh, no (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (Come on, I need some kind of sign)
If we all cry (Cry with me) at the same time tonight
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself, alright)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one, whoa (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
You can change the world (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight

Change the world



We pray for our fathers
Pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing

So this one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

When you sit there addressing
Counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping
And my heart is weeping
Because I'm keeping a place

For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

Home with their fathers
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee

Let's pray for all the lost children
Let’s pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well and wishing them home

Eighty-five, ninety, ninety-five, one hundred
Here I come, ready or not
Last one into the forest is a rotten apple
It's so quiet in the forest
Look at all the trees
And all the lovely flowers
It's getting dark
We better go home now



He gives a nervous smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been going on
She says, "Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"

"Everything will be alright", he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy"
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
See whatever happens, don't go of my hand
See whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, just don't let go of my hand

Thank you, man
Thank you, Carlos



Tonight's story is somewhat unique
And calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh, yes, I did forget something, didn't I?
I forgot to introduce you to the monster

You're fearing me 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watchin' you when you sleep
When you're in bed, I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall
And when you scream, it's 'cause of me

I'm the living dead
The dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should feel threatened by me

You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
In one blink, I'll disappear
And then, I'll come back to haunt you

I'm tellin' you
When you lie under tomb
I'm the one watchin' you
That's why you got to be threatened by me (No, no)

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened by me

The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened (No, no, baby)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened

(You should be)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(While you sleep)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(Every time)
(You should feel)
(Threatened)
(Half of me-e-e-e)
(Threatened by me)
(So you should feel thre-e-e-eatened by me)

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened (No, no, know it)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened (She speaks to me)
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should feel threatened (And you, threatened by me, hoo-hoo!)
You should be watchin' me (Come on, baby)
You should feel threatened (Yeah)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Hoo-hoo!)
Every time your lady speaks (I ain't threatened)
She speaks to me, threatened (Hoo-hoo, I ain't threatened)
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened by me

What you have just witnessed
Could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't
It's the beginning
