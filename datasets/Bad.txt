Liberian girl, you came and you changed my world
A love so brand new
Liberian girl, you came and you changed me, girl
A feeling so true

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says, "Do you love me?"
And he says, "So endlessly
I love you, Liberian girl"

Nakupenda pia
Nakutaka pia (Ooh-ooh, baby)

I watched you on the floor, cheek-to-cheek
She's getting to you
You didn't see her eyes on me, no
She looked right through you
(Before you make) Before you make
(A big mistake) Remember
That looks can fool you, babe, hee
There's something I would sure appreciate
(If you can keep a secret)

Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
Baby loves me, no, she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me, ooh)

And if they ask her
Tell 'em that we're just good friends
Dah-chika, chika-chika
Just good friends
Ah-chika, chika-ah-ooh

You better take advice, never trust first impressions
I tried to hide this affair from their suspicions
So even if she's asking you to stay
You better know where you stand

Baby loves me, though she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
But my baby loves me, though she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me, ooh)

I guess the lady is still making up her mind
Say we're just good friends (Oh)

Baby loves me, though she never shows she cares
No, you won't see her kiss and hug me (Just good friends)
My baby loves me, though she acts like I'm not there (Aaow)
You doggone lover, hee, no-no-no-no

Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares (She loves me)

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh, yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ohh yeah!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man, you know, that man)
(Well I'll change!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Gonna feel real good (Oh, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na)
Yeah, yeah, oh no, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, hoo!
(Man in the mirror) You've got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You've got to, you got to move, shamone, shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah), stand up (Make that change), stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Aaow! (Yeah, make that change)
Go make that change, shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)
Make that change



Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (Ah), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do" (I do)
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you (Woah-oh)
I just can't stop loving you (If I stop)
And if I stop (Uh-huh)
Then tell me just what will I do (Woah-oh)
I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you (No, baby, oh)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop (Oh, oh)
Then tell me just what will I do (Oh, oh, what will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Hee-hee-hee, love you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (I know I do)
And if I stop (Oh, oh, oh)
Then tell me just what will I do



You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

She's saying "That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back"
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
(Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no)

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's saying "That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star"

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Diana
Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana, -iana, -iana
C'mon!
No, no, oh-, stop this

She said "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"

Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright"
I said "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key"
She said "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me"

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)

It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, theyâ€™re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Whoâ€™s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

Aaow!
Hoo-hoo!

I don't care what you talkin' 'bout, baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama
I don't care anyway
Time after time, I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb, baby
All is goin' my way

('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know?
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin', baby?

So just leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around (Just stop doggin' me)
Hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!

There was a time I used to say "Girl, I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now, who is sorry now?
You got a way of makin' me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walkin', beggin', I ainâ€™t lovin' you
Don't you get in my way

('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know?
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin', baby?

So just leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around
Hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!
Aaow!
