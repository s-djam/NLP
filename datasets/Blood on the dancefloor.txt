Ah, she got your number, ah. she know your game, ah
She put you under, ah, it's so insane, ah
Since you seduced her, ah, how does it feel, ah
To know that woman, ah, is out to kill?

Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now, you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now, you do regret it

To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side (Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now, she's out to get me
But I just can't take it, just can't break it

Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie got your number and Susie says it right

She got your number, ah, how does it feel, ah
To know this stranger, ah, is about to kill?
Ah, she got your baby, ah, it happened fast, ah
If you could only, ah, erase the past, ah

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know it's fled its tomb
Because now it's haunting me, I don't understand it!

Hey!
I don't understand it!
Aaow!

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, I don't understand it!

Got a ghost, got a break in the walls (Hey!)
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?
(Don't understand it!)
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya? (I'm sayin'!)
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it (I said)

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?

You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, don't understand it!

Got a ghost, got a break in the walls (Yeah-yeah!)
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?
(Don't understand it!)
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?

Doggone
But listen, try to find, a piece of mind
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?



There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of a heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghostly haunting everywhere

I'm gonna be exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me because you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see eccentric oddities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?
Ooh, babe

There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin, it lay open
Where a restless soul is smoking

I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
So tell me, is it scary for you, baby? Tell me, hoo!
So tell me, is it crazy for you, baby?
Am I scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you?

Masquerade the heart is to hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you seek of me
'Cause the heart reveals the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See, the evil one is you

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
So tell me, am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Is it scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Am I scary for you, boy? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)

(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)

Is this scary for you, baby?
Is this scary for you?
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you, baby? Oh
Oh, baby
