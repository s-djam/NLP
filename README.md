# NLP

This aims to get started with natural Language Processing (NLP) by performing sentiment analysis on Michael Jackson's discography from his album "Off the wall" (1979) to "Invicible" (2001), so there's 80 songs in total.  Lyrics have been collected through the Genius website. Here we're working with 8 datasets : 1 dataset with the lyrics from all albums, 7 other datasets specific to each album.

Goals : 
- To extract significant insights from song lyrics and to get impactful vizualisations.
- To understand MJ's lyrics through different eras more in depth, especially the emotions conveyed by them.

Tasks :
- Data preprocessing : removing stop words, tokenization, lemmatization
- Wordcloud vizualisation
- Topic modelling
- Sentiment analysis and vizualisation of the outcomes

All these tasks will be performed on the global dataset, and then with the albums datasets to see the lyrics' evolution through the albums.
